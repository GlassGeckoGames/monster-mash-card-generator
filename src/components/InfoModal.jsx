          <li><strong>Health:</strong> Determines the HP of the card. When this reaches zero, your card is destroyed, and your overall life is decreased by one.</li>
          <li><strong>Damage:</strong> Determines the attack strength of the card. This is the damage done to an opponent's card when you win a fight.</li>
          <li><strong>Defence:</strong> Determines the defensive strength of the card. This stat indicates how many slots on the roulette wheel you have when being attacked.</li>
          <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Indicates how many slots on the roulette wheel you have when attacking, determining the likelihood of successful attacks.</li>

A roulette wheel is used to determine the winner, with the weights of accuracy and defence influencing the outcome. So if your attack is higher than the defender's defence, you have a much higher chance of winning the fight.</p>
